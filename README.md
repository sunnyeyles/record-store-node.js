# Record Store

This exercise includes a series of tasks throughout the backend module. What we'll be learning and doing from now on:

- mock database using lowdb
- middleware and cors
- routes and error handling
- models and seeding
- controllers
- validate and sanitize data
- relations
- authentication
- deployment

Each time a different task will be given, so please work on this repo and build your server step by step. All you need to do is to push your code after each task. By the time we use mongoose(mongoDB), we can also build our frontend using reactJS and connect to our server. Finally, we can create our first MERN-stack app! You can add it to your portfolio. 

## Happy coding!
